# Recovery of Subspace Structure from High-Rank Data

This repository will (**soon!**) contain the source code for the **Accurate Subspace Segmentation by
Successive Approximations** (*A3SA*) method, proposed in the paper [Recovery of Subspace Structure from High-Rank Data](files/icip-2019-jcarvalho-paper.pdf), published at the 2019 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (2019), Taipei, Taiwan. You can also find [here](files/icip-2019-jcarvalho-paper.pdf) the poster presented at the conference.
